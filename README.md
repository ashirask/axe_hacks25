Our team made a website using streamlit to compile dashboards built on tablaeu which depicts data about tv shows and movie's box office collection. 
We began scraping a website that included data about movies internationally. Simeltanously, we built our streamlit based website. During that time we 
recovered a TV Show database and created 4 various dashboards to depict the popularity of tv shows in the U.S. After scraping the movies website, 
we finished building the rest of our dashboards. We faced a challenge of importing it to our stremlit code so we created buttons to let the user see a full 
insight of the dashboards in the Tablaeu public view.
